DatabaseManager.java:

This Java class acts as a bridge between the application and the database using JDBC. It typically provides:

Connection setup using the JDBC Type 4 driver (e.g., MySQL Connector/J).

Methods to perform database operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

Helper functions to handle SQL exceptions, manage result sets, and close connections properly.

Encapsulation of SQL logic to keep the rest of the application decoupled from database code.

Java Project.sql â€“ Database Schema:
